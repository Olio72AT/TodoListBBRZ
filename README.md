Branch (V3-AddTodo)

Project TODOList - >

Implementation of a TODO List so far with
- 1:1 relationship
- 1:n relationship

"MusterlÃ¶sung"

DONE: 

a) ResourceVM DeleteTodo -> needs a inquiry, if you really want to "DEACTIVATE"
the TODO regarding this particular Resource.


TDB: (To be done)

b) ResourceVM AddTodo -> We need to implement AddTodo to associate exisiting Todos
to this Resource.


What we need to do now: 

1) Ask yourself, how you would implement the AddTodo?
