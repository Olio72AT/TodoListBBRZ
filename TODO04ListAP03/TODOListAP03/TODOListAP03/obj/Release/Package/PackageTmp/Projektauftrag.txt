## TODO List


1) Browse the old projects, we have done and try to remember the logic behind it
2) Create the Details View for the Todos Model in the Todos Controller ... 
3) Try to delevop "senseful" data annotations for the Todos, so that users can only enter valid data
4) Add 2 TODOS items initially, when starting the APP. (Global A) 
5) Make sure, that users can only enter Todos, when the corresponding DetailsID is existing -> 
Todos.DetailsId == Details.Id

-> In case it does not exist -> Return an ViewBag.Error Message ("DetailsId does not match given Details")

Have fun ... ;)
